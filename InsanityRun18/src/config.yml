# Config file for InsanityRun by WauloK
# http://www.ObsidianLoft.com/
# Do not edit this! Use commands!

# useVault - Should we try to hook to vault for payments/charges ?
# vaultCharge - Will we be charging players for runs?
# useLanguage - Which language should we use? Other languages will be posted to the plugin page.
# idleKickTime - If players stop moving, kick them out of the game after this many seconds. 4 works well.
# broadcastWins - Broadcast run times and coins collected to the whole server or just the player
# noEndTeleport - If this is true, when players reach the end of the run they will not teleport to the sign.
# useCheckpoints - If this is true, when players cross the checkpoint they will teleport back to it when landing in water/lava
# waterRestartsRun - If player lands in the water/lava, restart the run at the run spawn. Don't set this and checkpoints to true.
